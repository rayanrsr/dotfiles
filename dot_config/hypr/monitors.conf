# Monitor Configuration
# DP-1: 27" 4K 60Hz (HKC N07), positioned on the left, scaled to match DP-2
# At 1.5x scale, effective width is 3840/1.5 = 2560 pixels
monitor=DP-1,3840x2160@60,0x0,1.5

# DP-2: 27" 4K 160Hz (P275MV PLUS) - MAIN, positioned to the right (center), scaled to 1.5x
# At 1.5x scale, DP-2 effective width is 3840/1.5 = 2560 pixels
# DP-1 effective width at 1.5x is 2560px, so DP-2 starts at x=2560
# Enable 10-bit color and HDR color management on this display

# Workspace Monitor Assignments
# DP-2 is main (term/code/web). DP-1 is secondary (comms/gaming/graphics).
