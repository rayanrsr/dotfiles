# Monitor Configuration
# DP-2: 27" 4K 160Hz, positioned on the left, scaled to 1.5x
# At 1.5x scale, effective width is 3840/1.5 = 2560 pixels
monitor=DP-2,3840x2160@160,0x0,1.5

# DP-1: 34" ultrawide 3440x1440, positioned to the right of DP-2
# Starts at x=2560 (DP-2's effective width after scaling)
monitor=DP-1,3440x1440@99.98,2560x0,1

# Workspace Monitor Assignments
# Keep the same pattern as before, but replace the old HDMI monitor with DP-2
