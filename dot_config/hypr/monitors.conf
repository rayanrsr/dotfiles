# Monitors (Hyprland)
# Both are 4K. Using scale 1.5 on both => logical width = 3840/1.5 = 2560
# So the right monitor must start at x = 2560 (not 2161).
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# You swapped the cables, so the connector names effectively swapped:
# - Left monitor (HKC N07, 4K@60) is now DP-2
# - Main/center monitor (P275MV PLUS, 4K@160) is now DP-1
monitor=DP-2,3840x2160@60,0x0,1.5
monitor=DP-1,3840x2160@160,2560x0,1.5

# Keep the same physical intent as before (main/center monitor gets the "main" workspaces).
# Since P275MV PLUS is now DP-1, point the main workspaces at DP-1.

# GTK scaling
# Don't force GDK_SCALE=2 if you're already using per-monitor scaling (1.5),
# it usually causes double-scaling / inconsistent app sizes.
# Prefer GDK_SCALE=1 and optionally use GDK_DPI_SCALE if needed.
